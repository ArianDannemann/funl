funl
====

Rough prototype of what could become a fun functional language.

Example
-------

println("Did you know that...")
i = int(0)
loop = {
    println("funl is considered to be *perfect*?")
    i = add(i(), int(1))
    eval(i(),"<",10,loop)
}
loop()

Features
--------

- Everything is global (I have not added scopes.. yet(?))
- Everything is either a function definition or a function call
- funl is supposed to be strongly typed, but I will not guarantee that
- Almost all of the file size comes from excessive use of parentheses

Usage
-----

source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m funl.main
